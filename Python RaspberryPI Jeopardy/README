This project was designed by team members Tony Attala, Louise Cooke, and Alexander Massin.
It was an attempt at making a Raspberry Pi trivia game using GIPO ports soldered with Buttons.
The code is not fully functional but it was one of the few projects that sparked my creativity.

I do not take full credit for the code provided though post it here in case anyone wants to tinker with it.
